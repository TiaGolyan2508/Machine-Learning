Decision Tree Classification on Diabetes Dataset
This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier on the PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on health parameters.

Steps Followed
Imported required Python libraries

Loaded the dataset (diabetes.csv)

Displayed basic info (head, missing values, target distribution)

Handled missing values by replacing zeros with median values

Performed EDA using histograms, heatmap, and pairplot

Selected features (X) and target (y)

Split the data into training and test sets

Built a Decision Tree using the Gini index

Evaluated the model using classification metrics

Visualized the tree structure

Optimized the model using Entropy (Information Gain)

Visualized the entropy-based tree

Plotted confusion matrix and calculated precision, recall, and F1-score

Tools Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Seaborn, Matplotlib
